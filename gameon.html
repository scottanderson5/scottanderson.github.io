						<p>The idea for GAMEon came from Friday afternoons at the Iron Yard. During this time we closed our computers and played games with each other. It was an awesome opportunity to relax the brains and feed the need for relaxation. These games were board games and card games I had never played before. In fact, I had never even heard of them. Yet they became such an important part of my week that I began to wish there was a way I could learn about other unknown games.</p>
						<p>GAMEon would be about discovery and opportunity. Discovery for the user to find new games they had never heard of, and opportunity for the game developer to market and receive feedback on their products. </p>

					Research

						<p>I then came up with the idea for a web app, one where the user could receive a random board or card game in the mail, play it, return or buy it, and then rate and review it. Being able to make this process understandable for new users, I knew, was going to be the main challenge. I started with some preliminary research to aid the process along. </p>
						<p>I began with a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis. This allowed me to see where the app would succeed, or possibly fail. In order to make sure the positives, and not the negatives, were approached in the design would be crucial. Plus it would provide me with some possible directions the app could go in.
						</p>
						<p>I created User Personas to help give me a general idea of some potential users for the site. By starting with a broad scope, I could eventually find a middle-ground in which all were able to easily navigate the pages. I focused on people young and old, married and single, families and empty-nesters. All were created to see why they may be interested in discovering new board and card games.
						</p>
						<p>
						I then moved forward, with these fictional users I created, and gave them individual stories, or scenarios. This aided me in seeing how they each may approach the app in a given situation, and what features may, or may not, need to be included.

						<p>The beginning of the design process started with sketches, a very non-commital method for exploring possible options and directions. Eventually, I was satisfied with sketches for each possible page of the app.</p>
