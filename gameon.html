						<p>The idea for GAMEon came from Friday afternoons at the Iron Yard. During this time we closed our computers and played games with each other. It was an awesome opportunity to relax the brains and feed the need for relaxation. These games were board games and card games I had never played before. In fact, I had never even heard of them. Yet they became such an important part of my week, and I began wishing there was a way I could learn about other unknown games.</p>
						<p>GAMEon would be about discovery and opportunity. Discovery for the user to find new games they had never heard of, and opportunity for the game developer to market and receive feedback on their products. </p>

						<p>I then came up with the idea for a web app, where the user would receive a random board game or card game in the mail, play it, return or buy it, and then rate and review it. Being able to get this idea across, I knew, was going to be the main challenge. I started with some preliminary research to aid the process along. </p>
