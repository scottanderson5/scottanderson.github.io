						<p>The idea for GAMEon came from Friday afternoons at the Iron Yard. During this time we closed our computers and played games with each other. It was an awesome opportunity to relax the brains and feed the need for relaxation. These games were board games and card games I had never played before. In fact, I had never even heard of them. Yet they became such an important part of my week that I began to wish there was a way I could learn about other unknown games.</p>
						<p>GAMEon would be about discovery and opportunity. Discovery for the user to find new games they had never heard of, and opportunity for the game developer to market and receive feedback on their products. </p>

					Research

						<p>I came up with the idea for a web app, one where the user could receive a random board or card game in the mail, play it, return or buy it, and then rate and review it. Being able to make this process understandable for new users, I knew, was going to be the main challenge.</p>
						<p>To get started I used a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis, user personas, and user scenarios to begin the creative process.</p>
						

						<!--<p>Another challenge would be time. My time frame for this project was two weeks, which was not a lot. To complete the desired outcome I needed to be diligent with my time. To help me with this, I set up a Trello board and deployed an agile system for all my steps along the way.</p>
						<p>I began with a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis. This allowed me to see where the app would succeed, or possibly fail. In order to make sure the positives, and not the negatives, were approached in the design would be crucial. Plus it would provide me with some possible directions the app could go in.
						</p>
						<p>I created User Personas to help give me a general idea of some potential users for the site. By starting with a broad scope, I could eventually find a middle-ground in which all were able to easily navigate the pages. I focused on people young and old, married and single, families and empty-nesters. All were created to see why they may be interested in discovering new board and card games.
						</p>
						<p>
						I then moved forward, with these fictional users I created, and gave them individual stories, or scenarios. This aided me in seeing how they each may approach the app in a given situation, and what features may, or may not, need to be included.

					Design

						<p>The beginning of the design process started with sketches, a very non-commital method for exploring possible options and directions. Eventually, I was satisfied with sketches for each possible page of the app and move onto stile tiles, to explore possible colors, fonts, etc.</p>
						<p>I then constructed wireframes and mockups in Illustrator, starting to get a more exact feel for the layout of the app.</p>
						

						<!--<p>What's funny is that I did not actually use any one of the stile tiles I constructed in its entirety. What I did do was borrow elements from all three, such as colors and themes. So in the end, the design ended up being a mish-mash of all three with some extra elements added later. I was also experimenting with a different name for the app during this period of the process. Needless to say, I moved on to a better name once it came to me later.
						</p>
						<p>I also laid out some wifeframes in Illustrator so that I could get a nice look at the layout of the site, almost like looking at its skeleton. This allowed me the chance to try different sizes of the individual elements on the page, and to get a grasp of each ones spacing.
						</p>
						<p>
						While constructing the mock-ups I started using some fonts that were not present in the stile tiles. Also, I used colors that I had put in the tiles earlier, but I also started looking at new ones that would possibly work in the overall design.

						<p>The app itself was coded with HTML and SCSS. I also used Jekyll, allowing me to separate my styling sheets and import them into my main SCSS file. This created a clean, organized code. JQuery was used to add some functionality to the page.</p>
