						<p>The idea for GAMEon came from Friday afternoons at the Iron Yard. During this time we closed our computers and played games with each other. It was an awesome opportunity to rest the brains and feed the need for relaxation. These games were board games and card games I had never played before. In fact, I had never even heard of them. Yet they became such an important part of my week that I began to wish there was a way I could learn about other unknown games.</p>
						<p>GAMEon would be about discovery and opportunity. Discovery for the user to find new games they had never heard of, and opportunity for the game developer to market and receive feedback on their products. </p>

					Research

					<div class="project-text-top">	
						<p>I came up with the idea for a web app, one where the user could receive a random board or card game in the mail, play it, return or buy it, and then rate and review it. Being able to make this process understandable for new users, I knew, was going to be the main challenge.</p>
						<p>To get started I used a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis, user personas, and user scenarios to begin the creative process.</p>

					Design

					<div class="project-text-top">	
						<p>The beginning of the design process started with sketches, a very non-commital method for exploring possible options and directions. Eventually I moved onto stile tiles, to explore possible colors, fonts, etc.</p>
						<p>I then constructed wireframes and mockups in Illustrator, starting to get a more exact feel for the layout of the app.</p>

						<p>While constructing mockups in Illustrator, I also created a logo and icons for the app.</p>
						<p>These icons where used in various places throughout the page, adding a subtle, whimsical playfulness to the site. They were also instrumental in conveying the app's purpose and flow to the user.</p>

					Coding and Construction

						<p>The app itself was coded with HTML and SCSS. I also used Jekyll, allowing me to separate my styling sheets and import them into my main SCSS file. This created a clean, organized code. JQuery was used to add some functionality to the page.</p>
						<p>I also utilized a grid mixin to help make the page fully responsive and organized.</p>

					Challenges Faced
				</div>
				
				<div class="project-text-wrap">	
					
					<div class="project-text-top">	
						<p>The first obstacle was time, I only had two weeks. In order to make the most of my time I decided to use an Agile method, and I constructed a Trello board to help me organize all the tasks which needed to be completed in this short time frame.</p>
						<p>Another challenge was making sure that this process (ordering and receiving a random game in the mail, playing it, returning it, and reviewing it) made since to new users. To overcome this it was important to include a diagram, so to speak, of the process on the home page. I also wanted to make sure the profile page would convey a clear example of a user during a certain step in the overall process. To test this out I asked my wife, who works at a financial consulting agency, to send the app out to her co-workers and ask them if it made sense. All who looked at it said they were able to understand the process.</p>
