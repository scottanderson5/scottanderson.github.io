						<p> Black Sheep Lodge is one of my favorite places to grab some food and watch a game in Austin. Unfortunately, their <a href="http://www.blacksheeplodge.com/" target="_blank"> webpage </a>leaves something to be desired.</p>
						<p> As a tribute to a place I love so much, I decided to embark on a re-design of their webpage. This was not for them or for profit, just for my own personal project.</p>

						<p>I did a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. This helped me great a picture of what their key, individual traits were.</p>
						<p>I also completed a wordlist so that I could tie together common themes, sights, and feelings from the restaurant.</p>

						<p>For the overall look of the site, I created a stile tile which helped me see if  my ideas for theming, fonts, and color would work well together or not.</p>

						<p>I coded the webpage with HTML, SCSS, Jekyll and JQuery. I mixed in a grid system as well, to aid me in overall organization and the webpages responsiveness.</p>
						<p>I also only coded out the home page and the menu page, in the interest of time.</p>

					Challenges Faced

					<div class="project-text-top">	
						<p>The menu page was one of the struggles I faced with this project. I went through many different layouts before making a final decision. I also played around with different font-sizes and colors to convey the hierarchy needed on the page. This was to not only describe the individual items, but also the different, broader, categories on the menu page.</p>
						<p>I also struggled with how to display the current beers they have on tap. For example, I originally wanted to put the list on the menu page. But after consideration and peer feedback, I put it on the home page. I made this decision because I figured a main reason people would come to the page would be to see the current beers on tap. I did not want to hide that information. I wanted it to be easily called out and accessible.</p>
