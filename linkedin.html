						<p> LinkedIn is so very fascinating. Most everyone I know has a LinkedIn profile. And most everyone I know that has a LinkedIn profile, doesn't like LinkedIn.</p>
						<p> There is no exact reason as to why most people hold a certain disdain for it. After interviewing a few friends and colleagues about why they didn't like it, there were many answers. But one recurring answer most gave was that they found the layout confusing and overbearing. That's a problem I could potentially solve.</p>

						<p> Before I could start designing and coding a new LinkedIn home page, I needed to try to find out what the issues where. I put users through an experimental test, giving them taks to do and see how well they completed them.</p>
						<p> I also found out what aspects of LinkedIn people liked, and what they disliked. It was vital to make those likeable features prominent, while eliminating the features they didn't like.</p>
						<p>I then mapped out a userflow, so I could get a big idea of how a user may get to a potential feature on LinkedIn.</p>

						<p>The sketches were a way for me to see what the final layout could look like. They also gave me a preliminary look at the different responsive layouts. The home page mockup, done in Illustrator, was my first chance to see colors and font styles and layouts, and decide on what the final look would be before coding.</p>

					Challenges Faced

					<div class="project-text-top">	
						<p>The research portion of this project was the biggest challenge for me. People I interviewed had a variety of reponses as to what they liked and didn't like in LinkedIn. And while some features may have been pretty much appreciated, there were some that everyone had mixed feelings on. Advertisements for instance. People don't like the ads, yet at the same time they said they understood why they were there. So deciding on wether to leave in a space for ads or not was a decision not reached easily.</p>
