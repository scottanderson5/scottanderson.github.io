Since leaving the Iron Yard it has been one big whirlwind after another. Applying for jobs, going on interviews, keeping my home organized, etc. But during these past few weeks I have been attempting to up my skills even more.

*Get better, get stronger, get wiser.*

By no means am I the best person ever when it comes to, say, CSS. I'm very strong at it, but can always continue to learn more about it. However, that doesn't mean I can't try to add a few more tools to the box at the same time.

There are two reasons why I want to continue the learning process: To improve my overall abilities and because I like it.
