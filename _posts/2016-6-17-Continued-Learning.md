Since leaving the Iron Yard it has been one big whirlwind after another. Applying for jobs, going on interviews, keeping my home organized, etc. But during these past few weeks I have been attempting to up my skills even more.

*Get better, get stronger, get wiser.*

By no means am I the best person ever when it comes to, say, CSS. I'm very strong at it, but can always continue to learn more about it. However, that doesn't mean I can't try to add a few more tools to the box at the same time.

There are two reasons why I want to continue the learning process: To improve my overall abilities and because I like it. That's great motivation for me. However finding the time to learn and developing a new system for doing so is a hinderance. A big one.

Not to mention...Javascript is hard.

*Can I do this?*

There is a big reason why knowing the Javascript language is desired by so many people, companies, agencies, etc. Not many people can do it. Not many people can do it well. 

I remember seeing the front-end clas during my time at the Iron Yard. They were an awesome bunch, always down for a coffee break or to see what we were up to over in the design classroom. And I also remember seeing them on Monday mornings, just befoe the weekend assignments were due. The looks of angst, stress, and exhaustion littered the canvas of faces. I didn't know exactly what they were doing or what they were working on. Yet, I could tell that whatever it was, it was hard.

Very hard.

*Can I do this?*

Fast forward a few months and here I am, signed up for Codeacademy's Javascript course. I am trying to figure all of this stuff out, trying to make it compute. 

I had some Javascript experience in class at The Iron Yard, but that was only for a couple of days. But during that time I felt like I was beginning to grasp it and get pumped about it. But now I am back at square one, frustrated, and starting to stress a little bit, just like my front-ender friends were.

I'm thinking that there must be other methods of learning out there, and there are. I download a Javascript game, if you can call it that, on my phone so that I can learn while on the go. Again, not the best method of learning for me. 

*Can I do this?*

Yes, yes I can. I just need to keep at it. 

Also, finding a proper learning method is crucial for me. The immersive culture and style that I experienced at The Iron Yard is absolutely the best route. However, my life doesn't put an option like that in play....for now.

In the meantime, I am reading about Javascript. Why? Because a foundation is the best starting place, like the man in the Bible who built his house upon the rock. By grasping a strong understanding of the language, I can understand what I am doing, and what is going on, before I delve too deep into the code. Let's learn all we can about it first, and then lets go play in the sandbox. Better to understand the tool before using them.

It was take some time, patience, effort, feedback (love that one), advice, mentoring, and most importantly...practice.

Practice makes perfect, after all.

*I can do this.*
