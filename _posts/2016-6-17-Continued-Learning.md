Since leaving the Iron Yard it has been one big whirlwind after another. Applying for jobs, going on interviews, keeping my home organized, etc. But during these past few weeks I have been attempting to up my skills even more.

*Get better, get stronger, get wiser.*

By no means am I the best person ever when it comes to, say, CSS. I'm very strong at it, but can always continue to learn more about it. However, that doesn't mean I can't try to add a few more tools to the box at the same time.

There are two reasons why I want to continue the learning process: To improve my overall abilities and because I like it. That's great motivation for me. However finding the time to learn and developing a new system for doing so is a hinderance. A big one.

*Not to mention...Javascript is hard*

There is a big reason why knowing the Javascript language is desired by so many people, companies, agencies, etc. Not many people can do it. Not many people can do it well. 

I remember seeing the front-end clas during my time at the Iron Yard. They were an awesome bunch, always down for a coffee break or to see what we were up to over in the design classroom. And I also remember seeing them on Monday mornings, just befoe the weekend assignments were due. The looks of angst, stress, and exhaustion littered the canvas of faces. I didn't know exactly what they were doing or what they were working on. Yet, I could tell that whatever it was, it was hard.

Very hard.

*Can I do this?*

Fast forward a few months and here I am, signed up for Codeacademy's Javascript course.
