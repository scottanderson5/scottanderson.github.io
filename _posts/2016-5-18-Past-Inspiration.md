I am currently knee deep in the middle of my final project, and it's going to be a crunch to get what I want done in time. Luckily, I have found a form of inspiration to keep me going.

While coding I usually listen to music as I do so. I think it occupies that old ADHD side of my brain. But the form of music I usually listen to are broadway show tunes. 

*Pause for subtle jokes at my expense.*

Lately the show I have been listening to a lot is *Hamilton*. And for anyone who slightly follows the musical theater scene this is probably not surprising. I mean, it now holds the record for most Tony nominations in history (16). The show is sold out for the foreseeable future, and re-sale tickets are going for astronomical prices on StubHub and Ticketmaster. 

The show is that dang good, so the main reason I listen to the soundtrack is for the pure enjoyment factor while I'm coding at the computer. The music is upbeat, enriching, and dynamic.

*I hope someone talks about my designs that way...*

However it occured to me that there was more than one reason that I kept listening to this particular soundtrack. I love other broadway shows, and can just as easily listen to them instead. Yet, I find myself coming back to listen to *Hamilton* time and time again. Why? Maybe because of the man himself, Alexander Hamilton.

A young up and comer, trying to prove himself in a land of giants. He worked hard, harder than most anyone else, in order to gain an advantage over them. 

In fact, one of the most engaging songs in the show is one titled, "My Shot." In it, Hamilton exuberantly proclaims that he is not throwing away this shot he has: his shot to leave a legacy behind and make a name for himself and guarantee the freedom of our country for future descendants. 

Gives me goosebumps everytime. 

As I sit and work on the final project it becomes easy at times for me to want to take too many breaks, or too long of breaks, or to just say, "You know what, I can work on this tomorrow." But I stop myself from doing that...mostly by listening to this song. No, time for rest is later. You need to work hard now. 

*The harder I practice, the luckier I get.*

Time is going to be a crunch, as the deadline for getting the project done is fast approaching. And even though there is a lot of work left to be done between now and then, I am moving forward confidently. I have a lot to prove, and I look forward to the challenge.

Because I'm not throwing away my shot.
