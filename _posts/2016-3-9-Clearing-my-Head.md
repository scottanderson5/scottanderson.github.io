In class today we had a visit from Clearhead, a company who happens to hold court in the office space adjacent to us at the Iron Yard. As luck would have it, they specialize in website validation and optimization. Their UX/UI team has agreed to meet us on Wednesday's to see what we are working on and to provide feedback for us. 

*Awesome!*

*Wait. What if they think my work is terrible?*

That was the first though going through my head. Maybe this fear is caused by a heavy case of imposter syndrome, thinking I don't yet belong in the web designer sphere.
