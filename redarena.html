						<p> <a href="http://www.redarena.org/" target="_blank">RED Arena</a> is a fantastic non-profit located in Dripping Springs. They were in need of developing an internal web app for their staff, patrons, and volunteers. Only working with a printed out spreadsheet posted in the back of a barn, they needed a better method of creating and sharing schedules.</p>
						<p> I partnered up with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/thedavidpowell" target="_blank">David</a>, and we set forth planning a design for their internal app which would be passed on to the developer.We also began a trello board, so that we could divvy up the tasks and be productive in a short amount of time.</p>

					Research

						<p>We interviewed one of the staff members, trying to get an idea of the non-profit itself, what they do, and what their struggles are. We also looked at the current schedules they used, and what its limitations where.</p>
						<p>We whiteboarded first, looking at what the individual needed to do once they logged on to the app. We also created a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis and some user scenarios. This would give us a broad range of users who would access the app, helping us know what they needed to see, and what needed to be included. </p>

						<p>We started with sketches, comparing our results before moving forward. We combined what we thought were our best ideas, and then put them into one layout. We approached the style tiles the same way, by doing individual projects and then combining the best elements into one.</p>
						<p>We also put some wireframes together in illustrator, to begin the preliminary stages of what would be the final layouts in mockups.</p>

					Challenges Faced

						<p>The first obstacle was time, I only had two weeks. In order to make the most of my time I decided to use an Agile method, and I constructed a Trello board to help me organize all the tasks which needed to be completed in this short time frame.</p>
						<p>Another challenge was making sure that this process (ordering and receiving a random game in the mail, playing it, returning it, and reviewing it) made since to new users. To overcome this it was important to include a diagram, so to speak, of the process on the home page. I also wanted to make sure the profile page would convey a clear example of a user during a certain step in the overall process. To test this out I asked my wife, who works at a financial consulting agency, to send the app out to her co-workers and ask them if it made sense. All who looked at it said they were able to understand the process.</p>
