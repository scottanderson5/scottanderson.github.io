						<p> <a href="http://www.redarena.org/" target="_blank">RED Arena</a> is a fantastic non-profit located in Dripping Springs. They were in need of developing an internal web app for their staff, patrons, and volunteers. Only working with a printed out spreadsheet posted in the back of a barn, they needed a better method of creating and sharing schedules.</p>
						<p> I partnered up with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/thedavidpowell" target="_blank">David</a>, and we set forth planning a design for their internal app which would be passed on to the developer. We also began a Trello board, so that we could divvy up the tasks and be productive in a short amount of time.</p>

						<p>We interviewed one of the staff members, trying to get an idea of the non-profit itself, what they do, and what their struggles are. We also looked at the current schedules they used, and what its limitations where.</p>
						<p>We whiteboarded first, looking at what an individual needed to do once they logged on to the app. We also created a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis and some user scenarios. This would give us a broad range of users who would access the app, helping us know what they needed to see, and what needed to be included. </p>

						<p>We started with sketches, comparing our results before moving forward. We combined what we thought were our best ideas, and then put them into one layout. We approached the style tiles the same way, by doing individual projects and then combining the best elements into one.</p>
						<p>We also put some wireframes together in illustrator, to begin the preliminary stages of what would be the final layouts in mockups.</p>

					Coding and Mockups

						<p>Once we got to the point where we needed to code the style guide itself and create mockups in illustrator, we completed the two separately. David took on the <a href="https://github.com/davidpowellme/red-arena/blob/master/design-research/red-arena.pdf" target="_blank"> mockups</a> and I coded the fully responsive<a href="http://www.scottandersonwebdesign.com/REDarena/" target="_blank"> style guide</a>. We worked side by side the entire time, allowing for the other to provide feedback and input.</p>
						<p>These were the final pieces we presented to RED Arena, and we made sure to continually ask for feedback and input from other designers we knew.</p>

					Challenges Faced

						<p>Time was a challenge, as we only had a few days to accomplish a lot of tasks. The best way we faced this obstacle was sitting and devising a plan first, and deciding to use a Trello board.</p>
						<p>After our first interview with the RED Arena staff member, we were a little overwhelmed with how much we had to accomplish in a short amount of time. By whiteboarding the process first we were able to calm our nerves and move forward. Also, the use of Trello and an Agile method was extremely useful and life saving.</p>
						<p>Working with a partner is 90% useful and 10% challenge. At times it's a challenge because we have differing views on how things should look and work, and we need to agree before moving forward. Luckily for me, David was extremely accomadating and open to any concerns and questions I had in the process. Eventually we learned that the best way to overcome the occasional difference in opinion was to listen to what the other had to say, then repeat to them what their point was. This was to convey that we were listening to each other, and understood what their point was. Then we woud offer our differing opinions and why. This provided a safe space, so to speak, to offer varieties of feedback.</p>
