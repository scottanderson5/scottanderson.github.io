    <p>As if the group project weekend wasn’t enough fun, now was time for another one.</p>

<p>This time we are working for a client. A real one, not even pretend. A non-profit agency in Dripping Springs (right outside of Austin) is in need of an internal web app for their administrators, staff, and volunteers. We split into team of two for this assignment as well, so that the client would have more than just one design to choose from.</p>

<p>To figure out what the essential functions of the app were we met with one of their staff members. In the essence of time, let me list out what the client requested in the app:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dashboard page</li>
  <li>Profile page</li>
  <li>Schedule page</li>
  <li>Printable schedule page</li>
  <li>Time off-request page</li>
  <li>Admin. approval request page</li>
  <li>Edits for profile page</li>
  <li>New appointment edit page</li>
</ul>

<p>(multiple sizes are also needed, as the app needs to be responsive)</p>

<p>After noting everything they hoped for, it was time to ask them general questions so we could start thinking about possible directions our designs could go. What the environment is like on a day by day basis, words that describe the agency, and other logistical questions were just some of the things we asked.</p>

<p>And then there were the class requirements for this project. Like before, in the interest of time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sketches for each client requirement</li>
  <li>Stile Tiles</li>
  <li>Wireframes (all sizes all pages)</li>
  <li>Mock Ups (all sizes all pages)</li>
  <li>Web responsive style guide</li>
  <li>At this point, the feeling of being overwhelmed creeped in upon me. Maybe my partner too.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Is there nothing else?</em></p>

<p>I found myself wondering, sarcastically, if anything had been left out. I just needed to breath, trust the abilities of myself and my partner, and get to work.</p>

<p>We started with a Trello board and created the user stories in the backlog. We then assigned points to them based on the amount of time we believed each one would take. Immediately I began to feel better. Seeing the process mapped out not only put nerves at ease, but we felt a small since of accomplishment.</p>

<p>At this time, I started thinking that Richard Dreyfuss’s character in <em>What About Bob?</em> was on to something:</p>

<p><em>Tiny steps. Tiny steps. Breathe. Repeat. Tiny steps.</em></p>

<p>That board, and the agile process, was a saving grace. It allowed us not only the ability to map out the process, but to assign the work between the two of us. We could see the steps. Beginning with that process, and trusting it, was a huge reason we were able to complete the project on time and satisfactorily.</p>

<p>My partner and I, with the help of the Trello board, did a good job in dividing the work between us. First, we completed sketches for corresponding pages. Then, after looking at our ideas, merged them into one idea. We then moved into the wireframing.</p>

<p>Once we were ready to construct stile tiles, we decided to approach it the same way that we approached the sketches. We split them up, each doing two, and then decided we would come back and look at them all together.</p>

<p>My partner and I couldn’t help but laugh. We had each picked similar themes for each tile, but had come up with pretty different looks. After discussion, we merged what we thought were the best elements from all four into one stile tile that we were both happy with.</p>

<p>Then came the mock-ups and style guide. David took the mock-ups, I took the style guide, and we worked side by side during the process. That way, we were constantly able to see where the other one was in their progression. We were also able to seek and offer feedback when it was needed. Eventually, we finished.</p>

<p><em>Phew…</em></p>

<p>The client will decide next week which team has the design they wish to move forward with. My fingers are crossed, but in any event I am happy with what was accomplished.</p>
