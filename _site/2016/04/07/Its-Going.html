    <p>Over the past 6 weeks people have been asking me, “How is it going?” I don’t usually have a great answer for them, and I chalk up some lame response like, “It’s Going.”</p>

<p>Why am I saying this? Honestly, I give this answer so much now it’s as if I’m on auto-pilot. But I think I might provide this part-dismissive response for more than reason:</p>

<p><strong>“I’m working here!”</strong></p>

<p>This is perhaps what I would like to say.</p>

<p><em>Back off. Leave me alone. If you’re going to interrupt, there better be food involved.</em></p>

<p>But that would be rude, so instead I reply, “It’s going.”</p>

<p>As I have been going through the learning process these past few weeks, it is easy to get very involved, very attuned to whatever it is I’m currently working on. Outside noises, smells, prying questions are just distractions I do not want to be interrupted with. And so me replying, “It’s going”, is my way of absently dismissing whoever is asking about the current progress (or lack thereof) I am experiencing.</p>

<p>Yet I have noticed that when this happens, it’s not as frequent as I may be thinking. If someone, such as my wife, comes up and asks how things are going it’s because she hasn’t seen me up and walking around for a while. I need to take that as a clue, that it’s time for a break. Doesn’t have to be a long one, but it is productive to take half an hour even and just stand up and walk around. Get my mind off of the project, protect my eyes from the screen, limit the carpal tunnel.</p>

<p><strong>“Not Sure….”</strong></p>

<p>This is an honest and polite answer.</p>

<p><em>I don’t know how much I have left.</em></p>

<p>I have learned that there is so much trial and error in coding. This past weekend we were working on a personal re-work of the LinkedIn home page. We were required to start with sketches, wireframe mockups, full mockups, and coding the page itself and making it responsive. We needed to include at least one JQuery in our code. And we needed to follow an existing style guide, mine was the U.S. Gov webpage. Once the page was coded and complete, we needed to do a rapid prototype with another style guide, which for me was the HealthCare.Gov webpage.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize until Sunday afternoon that this was a lot to get done in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>Getting the JQuery to work took me a while to figure out. During this time, I was asked, “How’s it going?” And honestly, I didn’t know. I could fix one id tag and it could work. I could be doing this completely wrong and need to start all over. I just didn’t know the answer for sure. And so, very politely, I answered, “It’s going.”</p>

<p><strong>“I’m making progress”</strong></p>

<p>Another honest answer, but more as a re-assurance to myself as opposed to someone asking me how everything was going.</p>

<p><em>This is taking a long time….but it’s getting done. Keep going. You can do this.</em></p>

<p>Yes, coding is a lot of work. This past weekends LinkedIn project was a lot of work. The projects we have had to complete before this one were a lot of work. But I am doing this. I am coding. That’s awesome.</p>

<p>When a project may seem daunting, and it’s inevitable that there is going to be a lot of work to be done, I just need to know that I can do this. There were many steps to be completed on the LinkedIn project, but tenacity and hard work paid off. And when frustration, anger, restlessness, joy(the JQuery finally worked) all reared up, I told myself, “It’s going.”</p>

<p>“It’s going” has become a powerful, small, phrase for me. Not for one of dismissive passivity towards inquiring friends and family, but as a motivational tool. One that reminds me of the importance of the project and the need for continued progress. But also, maybe most importantly, that I can do this and am learning and getting better everyday.</p>

<p>With that thought in mind, “It’s going” may be a phrase I use frequently going forward.</p>
