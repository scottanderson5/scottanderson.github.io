    <p>In class today we had a visit from Clearhead, a company who happens to hold court in the office space adjacent to us at the Iron Yard. As luck would have it, they specialize in website validation and optimization. Their UX/UI team has agreed to meet us on Wednesday’s to see what we are working on and to provide feedback for us.</p>

<p><em>Awesome!</em></p>

<p><em>Wait. What if they think my work is terrible?</em></p>

<p>That was the first though going through my head. Maybe this fear is caused by a heavy case of imposter syndrome, thinking I don’t yet belong in the web designer sphere. Maybe one day. But not yet. No way I can have stuff yet that they think is great or shows potential.</p>

<p>(Now is the part where I talk about how Clearhead proved me wrong.)</p>

<p>Patient, encouraging, and supportive. Those are some of the words I would use to describe their team. Never once did I feel judged or looked down upon. No, they were complementary. They mostly told us what they liked, describing ways they could see our designs prorgessing and improving. Never once did they absently dismiss anyones work.</p>

<p>This taught me an important lesson. Constructive feedback is important in all industries, it’s an effective method for improving productivity and increasing return. But in web design it is very very important. There is a subjectivity present in this line of work which is not quite as prevalent in other industries. The look of one webpage will be interpreted by people from varying backgrounds and opinions, and getting their feedback is highly valuable. There are many factors that come into play when crafting a new design, and you are never going to be aware of all those factors. Others are going to have to bring them to your attention.</p>

<p>Going forward, it will be vital for me to be paying attention to every detail and factor I can, while being open to those I may not readily see and others do.</p>
