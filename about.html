					<p>Born and raised in Dallas, Texas, I am a former church pastor and real estate agent. During those times in my life I became quite adept at listening. I listened to people convey their thoughts and desires, and helped them reach those individual goals. Yet, something was always holding me back. There was a part of me aching for something else.
					</p>
					<p>It was during my time in real estate that I became acquainted with online coding classes, such as Codeacademy. I enjoyed working on a computer, crafting interfaces from scratch, and seeing the fruits of my labor. For the first time in my life, I loved seeing what I was creating. 
					</p> 
					<p>If I was going to make this my career, I needed to "up my skills" so to speak. So I enrolled in the UI Design course at The Iron Yard in Austin. A 12-week intensive boot camp, I spent more than 80 hours a week working on various assignments and projects. All of this was aimed at molding me into a professional web designer. Want to know more about it? Check out the <a href="/blog/">blog.</a>
					</p> 
					<p>If you would like a sample of some of my past projects, please head over to the <a href="/work/.html">work</a> page.
					<p>In my free time I enjoy traveling, reading non-fiction, cringing while watching Game of Thrones, perfecting my burger recipe, completing the "honey-do" lists from my wife, and chasing my dog to get my shoe back.
