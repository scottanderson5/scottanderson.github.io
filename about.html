					<p>Born and raised in Dallas, Texas, I am a fomer church pastor and real estate agent. During those times in my life I became qute adept at listening. I listened to people convey their thoughts and desires, and helped them reach those individual goals. Yet, something was always holding me back. There was a part of me aching for something else.
					</p>
					<p>It was during my time in real estate that I became acquainted with online coding classes, such as Codeacademy. I enjoyed working on a computer, crafting interfaces from scratch, and seeing the fruits of my labor. For the first time in my life, I loved seeing what I was creating.
