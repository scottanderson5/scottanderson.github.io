						<p> <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a> is right of passage for many a web designer. The challenge: To create a beautiful and interesting web page without touching the HTML already provided. And the only language you are allowed to use is CSS/SCSS, a web designers best friend.</p>
						<p> The exercise itself it is a wonderful way to practice and perfect ones CSS skills. Using such items as "nth-child" and ":before" & ":after" becomes vital to completing the task.</p>

						<p>We started with sketches, comparing our results before moving forward. We combined what we thought were our best ideas, and then put them into one layout. We approached the style tiles the same way, by doing individual projects and then combining the best elements into one.</p>
						<p>We also put some wireframes together in illustrator, to begin the preliminary stages of what would be the final layouts in mockups.</p>

						<p>Once we got to the point where we needed to code the style guide itself and create mockups in illustrator, we completed the two separately. David took on the <a href="https://github.com/davidpowellme/red-arena/blob/master/design-research/red-arena.pdf" target="_blank"> mockups</a> and I coded the fully responsive<a href="http://www.scottandersonwebdesign.com/REDarena/" target="_blank"> style guide</a>. We worked side by side the entire time, allowing for the other to provide feedback and input.</p>
						<p>These were the final pieces we presented to RED Arena, and we made sure to continually ask for feedback and input from other designers we knew.</p>

					Challenges Faced

						<p>Time was a challenge, as we only had a few days to accomplish a lot of tasks. The best way we faced this obstacle was sitting and devising a plan first, and deciding to use a Trello board.</p>
						<p>After our first interview with the RED Arena staff member, we were a little overwhelmed with how much we had to accomplish in a short amount of time. By whiteboarding the process first, we were able to calm our nerves and move forward. Also, the use of Trello and an Agile method was extremely useful as well.</p>
						<p>Working with a partner is 90% useful and 10% challenge. At times it's a challenge because we have differing views on how things should look and work, and we need to agree before moving forward. Luckily for me, David was extremely accomadating and open to any concerns and questions I had in the process.</p>
