						<p> <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a> is rite of passage for many a web designer. The challenge: To create a beautiful and interesting web page without touching the HTML already provided. The only language you are allowed to use is CSS/SCSS, a web designers best friend.</p>
						<p> The exercise is a wonderful way to practice and perfect ones CSS skills. By not having access to anything but styling you can truly understand the power of good CSS.</p>

						<p> I began by looking at the HTML itself, thinking it best to explore what I had to work with before jumping into a plan. Indeed, the HTML was pretty sparce. This would require some deep thinking and attention.</p>
						<p> I would need to think of a design as well. I perused some already completed zen gardens to help me seek a path. This motivated me to draw inspiration from a particular genre or artform, as some others had done.</p>

					Design

					<div class="project-text-top">	
						<p>I decided to garner inspiration from Russian Constructivist artforms. There is an instant recognizability to the genre, and I knew that I could have fun putting something together.</p>
						<p>I did some quick research and found common elements that were present in constructivist pieces. This was to help me think of potential colors, fonts, and images. I wanted to grab some ideas from elsewhere while keeping the design, ultimately, mine. I drew some sketches so that there was some direction towards the potential layout of the page. Next, I put some stile tiles together to help me explore the various design possibilities.</p>

						<p>The project is coded with "HTML" and SCSS. I say "HTML" because I didn't write it. The only addition I made was a link to my stylesheet in the head. </p>
						<p>I was allowed to use SCSS in the code. This was not necessarly going to allow me an advantage. Rather SCSS gave me an air of comortability and perhaps convenience with the code I was writing. For example, I could nest certain elements within the classes.</p>
						<p>The site is fully responsive, so the zen garden can be viewed on all devices.</p>

					Challenges Faced

					<div class="project-text-top">	
						<p>The coding was a challenge, and I underestimated this project at first. Maybe I came into it a little arrogant, but I didn't see the whole "don't touch the HTML" part to be very daunting. Until it was. There were many times during the process where I wished I could simply add a div into the code to allow myself more leeway. I ended up having to rely on some methods I don't always use, such as "nth-child" and "::before" and "::after" to get the job done.</p>
						<p>In the end there were pieces of my zen garden that I thought were "complete" but perhaps not satisfied with. And so admittedly this is a project that I may come back to in the future and continue to tinker with.</p>
